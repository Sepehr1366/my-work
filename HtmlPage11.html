                something wonderful happens over the long simmer in the slow cooker the barley cooks to tender-chewy perfection,<br>
                the beef becomes meltingly tender, and the liquid thickens to a beautiful gravy.<br>
                brown the meat, toss it and everything else in the slow cooker,
                and let the magic happen. go with hulled, whole-grain barley here,
                and skip quick-cooking pearl barley; the latter isn't whole grain,
                and it will cook to mush over the long simmering time.<br>
                if you can't find hulled barley, you can try wheat berries,
                whole-grain farro, rye berries, or kamut instead. this soup is great for freezing,
                as it thaws and reheats beautifully.
